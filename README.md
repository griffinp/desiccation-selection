# desiccation-selection
Desiccation selection experiment scripts for data processing and analysis

These scripts were used to perform the data analysis detailed in the manuscript 'Multiple trajectories to the same desiccation phenotype: convergence and divergence in genomic responses among replicate selected Drosophila lines' by Philippa C. Griffin, Sandra B. Hangartner, Alexandre Fournier-Level and Ary A. Hoffmann (2016, under review).

All scripts developed by Pip Griffin, except the simulations detailed in Simul_selectionRegime.py and Simulation_plotting.R which were done by Alex Fournier-Level.
